# Firebase Push Notifications, with Java & Spring Framework

 [1]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/r1quX.jpg

a simple server for you to send push notifications to android devices.

### Written in Java / Spring Framework.

### Minimal code... and to the best of my abilities in Spring Framework, as clean as possible.

### Any suggestions for improvement will be greatly appreciated.
